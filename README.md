# Project PIR - NOMA system
This programme, run on Matlab, is used to simulate the NOMA system where each user transmits only one bit with the value of "1".
There are three parts including "encoding", "decoding" and "check"

# Encoding
It generates a transmission signal (superposition code) and a codebook for the users where all possible sum of codewords are unequal.

# Decoding
This part decode the signal received by eliminate the noise and then decode the superposition code to find active users. 

# Check
It is used to check if the signal decoded is same as the signal emitted.
